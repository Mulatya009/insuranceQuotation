This is a project build on HTML5, CSS3 and BOOTSTRAP4 (FRONTEND) and JAVASCRIPT;
The project involves a quotation of the insurance under certain parameters:

    2. Year
    3. Coverage level
    
this project is a study and practise project; it does not solve the real life problem in insurance
companies.
